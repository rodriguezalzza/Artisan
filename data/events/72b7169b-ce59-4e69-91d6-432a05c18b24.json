The bark is prepared and transformed into natural dyes, which are then applied to the fabric. The vivid colors are fixed using a special clay extracted from Amazonian rivers. This entire process embodies Iskonawa history and identity, as it is a practice carried out by women and passed down through generations. Today, these fabrics not only preserve ancestral design traditions but also help to imagine and shape the future of the Iskonawa people.\n\n"

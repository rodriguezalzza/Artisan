In a world where handmade pots have largely fallen out of use, the revival of Iskonawa pottery represents more than the recovery of a material object—it reclaims and re-signifies cultural practices that reflect the depth and richness of Iskonawa heritage. Through the careful process of shaping pots in a variety of traditional forms, this revitalization shows that Iskonawa culture continues to be vibrant and alive."
